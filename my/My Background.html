    <h1>My school and my life in School</h1>
    <p>I came to Phnom Penh on the 10th of January to study in PNC school (Passerelles Numeriques Cambodia). When I arrived my teacher sent me to live
       in CETC that is the place where all the studentsin my school live in. In my room there are 12 students frome different province that have 
       to live together and It is my first time that I live with a lot of people in a room, but It doesn't matter because we can live together 
       smoothly. In there I have a lot of new friends and new classmates. They are so kind and friendly. In my school I study in class 2023B on 
       the second floors. I study 8 hours a day, we need to study a lot in a day because we have only 2 years to study.</p>
